## A time to cast away atoms, and a time to gather atoms together
I was in Spokane, Washington when I first heard about the project. [Dr. Qingze Guan](https://physics.wsu.edu/people/faculty/qingze-guan/) and [Dr. Doerte Blume](https://www.ou.edu/cqrt/people/doerte-blume) invited me to a meeting to discuss some results from an experiment devised by [Dr. Peter Engels’ group](https://labs.wsu.edu/engels/). They had been working on a theoretical explanation and were now looking to include me. To be honest, the idea sounded uterly exigent for me so I wasn't excited. In the experiment, two Bose-Einstein condensates were made to collide, and the number of atoms scattered out of the condensates was measured. Their attention was in that some of these atoms ended up with negative momentum—something that shouldn't happen classically. The only way to explain it is through quantum mechanics: two atoms at rest scattering into equal and opposite momenta, $+\hbar \mathbf{k}$ and $-\hbar \mathbf{k}$. It was a subtle effect, but it was visible. I was right when I mentioned that the idea sounded uterly exigent but that was an underestimation of the cause. We quickly realized it was far more difficult and involved than expected—the more we worked on it, the more questions emerged. Before long, we started casually referring to it as **The Scattering Project**.

I still don’t have a faithful theoretical description of the experiment—but I can tell what we’ve come to understand so far. The core difficulty lies in the fact that the scattering process sits right at a delicate intersection where two very different types of physics compete. In the early stages of the collision, the behavior is distinctly quantum: the scattered atoms act like a collective excitation of the condensate, which we can get from the [Bogoliubov theory](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02745585). But as time goes on, the scattering becomes increasingly localized and lose coherence, so it cannot be described by elementary excitations anymore. Capturing this transition accurately is hard. It calls for beyond-mean-field methods, incorporating finite temperature effects, performing stochastic simulations, and even diagonalizing large matrices to resolve the excitation spectrum. What's more, the finite size of the BECs adds spatial inhomogeneity, which we try to account for using different types of [local density approximations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local-density_approximation). Moving smoothly between these descriptions—quantum to classical, mean-field to many-body—is precisely what makes the scattering project elusive, and intriguing.

I often talk with Dr. Engels' students about the scattering project—about how they cool down $^{87}\text{Rb}$ atoms to form a condensate, and how they use an optical lattice to split the cloud into two parts with distinct momenta. They then release the system and let it evolve freely; that's when the atoms collide and scatter away. The whole operation takes no more that $18\ ms$, they repeat these type of experiments overe again on a daily basis.

The whole activity reminds me a passage of the [Ecclesiastes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastes):

> A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together;

The original meaning speaks more about the *destruction-constrcuction dicotomy* and less about atoms in a quantum condensates. However, I picture people building a lab, cooling atoms down to near absolute zero, heating them back up, collecting data, permutating this and that parameter, running the experiment again. 


I imagine us feeding simple rules into a computer, forcing it to simulate the system from simple rules —believing, at some level, that those rules are fundamental. In that, I feel connected to the people who did all of this before me, whether with $^{87}\text{Rb}$ atoms or with stones. To me, this project feels like a kind of tradition: a way of doing something that has no final answer, no tidy resolution. Workout a difficult problem that solves nothing because this is what we, since the beggining, have been doing all the way. My collaborators would disagree.
